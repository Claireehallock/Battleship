# Battleship
This is a project created by Claire Hallock and Yulin Lin.

The Program simulates the Board Game Battleship for 2 players. The way it is intended to be used is that one person uses the console to place all of their ships, then the other person places all of their ships. The two players then alternate between firing on the enemy ships to try to win the game.
